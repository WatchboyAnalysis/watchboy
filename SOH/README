This folder contains the state of health codes. The code takes in a list of data files in the form of a txt file and produces a set of plots. 

The the code is executed as:
./soh filename

where filename is the name of the text file where the list of runs is stored without the name attachment. 

The plots are made in the same directory and have file names of 
filenameEventRateTable.C
filenamePMTRateTable.C
filenameCanvas.C

The canvases folder contains the scatter plots of the rates. 
The rateTables folder contains the same information but displayed as a density plot. 
The pmtTables contains information in the individual PMT rates for a given month, as well as the sigmas and means of the individual PMT pedestals. 

The scatter plots have been cleaned up some, and are reproduced in pdf and .C form in the plotsPDF folder.
